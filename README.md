# Tableau Challenge

**Tableau Public:** https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ben.calderaio/viz/tableau_challange/HolidayWeekHighlights

**Workbook:** tableau_challange.twbx

**Data File:** citi_bike_11-12-2022-1.csv

## Overview
This analysis was looked at November/December 2022.  The focus was based on ride counts during the Thanksgiving (11/18 - 11/27) and Christmas (12/23 - 12/31) weeks.

### Highlights
* Thanksgiving day had over 1160 riders compared to 245 riders on Christmas day
* Saturday, December 24 had the longest average ride duration at York St & Marin Blvd station
* Grove St Path was the most popular Start Station during this period
* Thanksgiving riders 15,317 vs. Christmas riders 8,835 (This can be seen in the workbook.)

### Notes
The workbook contains a story with three maps and 3 separate dashboards.  The workbook contains additional sheets for analysis.  I was not able to push the entire workbook to Tableau Public.  Tableau Public only let me publish one sheet or story.  Therefore, I created a highlight dashboard (See link above) and pushed that to Tableau Public.  The workbook with the data file can be found in this repository.
